Change Log of project RoPS_Deskriptor:

- Added the Pointers for lrf_matrix and iskeypoint to the function "computeLRF" in rops_estimation.hpp
- Changed the call of "computeLRF" in computeFeature in rops_estimation.hpp.
- changed call of computeEigenVectors in computeLRF in rops_estimation.hpp added iskeypoint.
- changed computeEigenvectors, calculation of isKeypoint is not made jet.
- changed Arguments of computeFeature in hpp and h.
- Problems with rops_descriptor -> construction of ROPSEstimator doesn't work.
- Problems with feature.hpp --> deleted solvePlaneParameters form .h and .hpp --> feature.h and feature.hpp work with original rops_estimation.h/.hpp
- changed the arguments of the project to deliver a PointCloud of LRFs to the main.
- Initialized the Keypointselection in rops_estimation computeFeature. The output PC of features has defined length through the input cloud.
	reducing the PC of Features must be made in rops_descriptor. Therefore a vector of booleans is needed to know which is a Keypoint.
	LRFs will be submitted as reduced cloud
- Keypoint detection is to be added.
